Project Description: Automated Testing of Playtech Website

In this project, I developed automated tests using Java, JUnit 5, and Selenide to verify the functionality and navigation of the Playtech website. The goal was to ensure a smooth user experience and validate the correctness of different sections and pages on the website.

The project involved the following test scenarios:

Career Page Verification:

Navigated to the Careers page of the Playtech website.
Asserted that the page title displayed "Careers at Playtech."
Internship Page Verification:

Navigated to the Internship page of the Playtech website.
Asserted that the page title displayed "Internship."
Section Navigation Verification:

Tested the navigation functionality of various sections on the website, including "Who we are," "Internship," "People and Culture," "Careers," "Contact Us," and "Blog."
Each navigation step was validated by asserting that the target page loaded successfully.
The project utilized the Page Object Pattern to organize the test code into reusable and maintainable components. Each test scenario was encapsulated within separate test methods, with corresponding helper methods to navigate to specific pages and perform assertions.

Selenide was used as a test automation framework due to its simplified API, automatic waits, smart locators, built-in assertions, and seamless integration with JUnit 5. Selenide allowed for efficient element interaction, validation, and synchronization with the application under test.

The project demonstrates my proficiency in automated testing using Java, JUnit 5, and Selenide. It showcases my ability to design and implement robust test cases, utilize the Page Object Pattern, and effectively perform assertions and navigation within a web application.
